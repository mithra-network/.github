# 🧭 Our Mission

Our mission is to support professionals and researchers to enhance and develop the cybersecurity risk assessment domain by informing and advancing the use of semi-automated risk assessment tools, methodologies and approaches through provision of tools, open knowledge exchange, collaborative learning, and advocacy.

# 🙌 Get Involved

We're building this community together - and you're invited!

Our goal is to bring together people who care about risk assessment, whether you're:

- 🧪 **Practitioners** - conducting real-world risk assessments
- 🛠️ **Researchers & developers** - creating semi-automated tools and methods
- 🏛️ **Policy makers & regulators** - applying assessments for compliance and governance

Not in one of those roles? No problem! If you're curious, interested, or just want to learn, you're welcome too. This is a space for open collaboration and shared learning.

Together, we can shape how risk is understood, assessed, and communicated.
